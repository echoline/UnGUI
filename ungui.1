.SH NAME
\fBUnGUI\fP \- Unix Concepts GUI

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ungui
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B UnGUI
is a graphical user interface which attempts to make visual a few
of the concepts behind a command-line interface, such as found on
a POSIX-compatible Operating System.  When combined with an X11
window manager, it can be the basis for a desktop environment.

.SH USE
UnGUI has a two types of windows in addition to the main toolbar.
The main toolbar allows users to add
.B Program
and
.B Data
windows.  Program windows specify programs which can be run as
explained below.  Data windows allow the user to edit, display,
and save text.

Data windows and Program windows can be linked together 
(formally `piped' in Unix) by pressing the
.B Connect
buttons on each in an ordered sequence.  This can be repeated
to link three or more items.  Linking has the effect of sending
data to or from a window of any type.  Program windows run the
specified program on the data sent when the
.B Run
button is clicked.  When this happens, Data windows display
incoming data and, if there is a link onwards, send it on.

.SH STORY
As computers moved into the home, user interface design
adapted, catering first to the management, and then to
those who wished the computer were a secretary.

Computers finally became a household appliance which no
one really understands; intentionally obfuscated.  People
who wish to understand are left pining for the computers
of the 1960's; long before recollection, or even birth.

What are the options?  A command line often comes in
handy; though the learning curve is steep.  Or succumb
to a household appliance which externalizes its possible
functionalities; always imposing upon you what you can
and cannot do.

This program is UnGUI, a graphical frontend to a Unix
environment which allows programs' inputs and outputs to
be piped together and used in ways similar to the shell,
except with a higher emphasis on graphical interface
concepts in the design of the software.
