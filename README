UnGUI: A GTK Non-Traditional Shell

As computers moved into the home, user interface design
adapted, catering first to the management, and then to
those who wished the computer were a secretary.

Computers finally became a household appliance which no
one really understands; intentionally obfuscated.  People
who wish to understand are left pining for the computers
of the 1960's; long before recollection, or even birth.

What are the options?  A command line often comes in
handy; though the learning curve is steep.  Or succumb
to a household appliance which externalizes its possible
functionalities; always imposing upon you what you can
and cannot do.

This program is UnGUI, a graphical frontend to a Unix
environment which allows programs' inputs and outputs to
be piped together and used in ways similar to the shell,
except with a higher emphasis on graphical interface
concepts in the design of the software.

The sourcecode aims to be simple, consistent, easy to
audit, and free of bugs.  Please fix any found.
