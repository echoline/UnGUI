UnGUI: A GTK Non-Traditional Shell

Long ago, Unix was the most prevalent Operating System.
As computers moved into the home, user interface design
adapted, catering to a lower and lower common denominator.
Computers finally became a household appliance which no
one really understands; no one can.  People who wish for
understanding are left pining for the computers of the
1960's; long before recollection, or even birth.

What are the options?  A command line often comes in
handy; though the learning curve is steep.  Or succumb
to a household appliance which externalizes its possible
functionalities; always imposing upon you what you can
and cannot do.

This program is UnGUI, a graphical frontend to a Unix
enviroment which allows programs' input and outputs to
be piped together and used in ways similar to the shell,
except with a higher emphasis on graphical interface
concepts in the design of the software.

The sourcecode aims to be simple, consistent, easy to
audit, and free of bugs.  Please fix them if found...
